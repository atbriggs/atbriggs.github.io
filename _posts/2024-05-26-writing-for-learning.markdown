I've heard about the benefits of writing from many different places. The most notable reason for me to start this is for my own learning. 

I find that I learn best when teaching, and when I have no one else to teach the best way is to write an article. It really makes me question my assumptions when I try to describe things in my own words, as well as identify knowledge gaps. 

My goals for this blog:
- aide my learning
  - as stated above: identify knowledge gaps
  - re-inforce the learning that I've done
- work on getting things into a "good enough" state and being happy with it
  - one of my problems is being a perfectionist, which prevents me from starting or completing something
- document my thoughts for later
  - making a reference for my memory
- help others who may be interested in learning similar things

I will be experimenting with what format and cadence works for me.
